Some notes about the supplied Windows DLL binaries and their build options:

A) The supplied i386 Windows DLL "zip32.dll" was compiled and linked with
   Microsoft Visual C++ 6.0 SP6 (Microsoft C 12.00).
   The link process provided:
     zip32.dll      the DLL executable
     zip32.exp      the exported symbol definitions
     zip32.lib      the import link library

   Compared to the settings as found in project file of the Zip232 source
   distribution, the following change was applied:

    * The build process was modified to use the assembler i386 CRC32 source
      instead of the generic C code.

   Please note:
   The Zip DLL is compiled with a structure member alignment setting of
   "-Zp4" (align at 32-bit boundary), which is NOT the default alignment
   setting of Microsoft C.
   In the current state, the Zip DLL code is not reentrant.  You should
   take caution when using the Zip DLL in a multi-threading environment.
