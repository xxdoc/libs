File naming conventions

There's really no major difference between the NTFS5 and FAT(32)
file naming conventions. Both file systems support long filenames
up to 255 characters in length. These filenames can contain any
characters, including spaces; however, there are a few
exceptions, which vary for each file system. In general, each
file system will preserve the case of a filename, but neither is
case-sensitive. In other words, HELP.txt and Help.txt are
considered the same file.



Which is faster?

It's difficult to determine which file system is faster, NTFS5 or
FAT(32). The decision is complicated because speed depends on the
size of the folder, and the location of the file in the folder.
When used on an appropriate volume size (and for small folders),
FAT(32) may be faster than NTFS because of its more basic
structure. FAT(32) also may be able to access files faster
because it doesn't have to first check file permissions, as NTFS5
does.

However, if the accessed file is badly fragmented, NTFS5 requires
fewer disk accesses to find the fragments because of its B-tree
folder structure. This B-tree structure also makes it faster to
access files in large folders on a NTFS5 volume than on a FAT(32)
one.



Support for large volumes

Microsoft designed NTFS5 for volumes larger than 500 MB to
eliminate the inefficiencies that result from using the FAT file
system. Microsoft doesn't recommend that you use NTFS on a volume
any smaller than 500 MB because of the overhead caused by the
system files and log file. As a result of this overhead, which
totals about 4MB, it's impossible to format a floppy disk with
the NTFS5 file system.

The practical size limit for an NTFS5 volume is 2TB and the
maximum file size is between 4GB and 64GB, depending on the
system's hardware. Because of these generous limitations, NTFS5
is much more accommodating than the FAT file system for today's
powerful systems.



Maximum File Size

FAT supports up to 2GB and FAT32 supports up to 4GB per single
file size. However, the way that NTFS first attempts to store
files entirely within the MFT record for the file. If the file is
too big, it extends the file's data using structures such as
external attributes and data runs. This flexible system allows
files to be extended in size virtually indefinitely. In fact,
under NTFS, there is no maximum file size. A single file can be
made to take up the entire contents of a volume (less the space
used for the MFT itself and other internal structures and
overhead.)



Security

Besides providing larger volume support, NTFS5 also excels in its
security features. Unlike the FAT file system, NTFS allows
permissions to be assigned to individual files and folders. It's
not a requirement that the files or folders be shared for them to
have NTFS5 permissions assigned to them. These permissions apply
to the local users as well as those users accessing the file over
the network.

NTFS5 also offers a variety of permissions, which allows for some
flexibility with your security policy. These permissions include
Read (R), Write (W), Execute (X), Delete (D), Change Permission
(P), and Take Ownership (O). For further explanation of
permissions and NTFS5 security, see the article "Combining NTFS
and shared permissions for network security."



Recoverability

Perhaps one of the most impressive features of the NTFS5 file
system is its recoverability. Through transaction-based
recoverability, NTFS5 guarantees the consistency of the volume.
Transaction logging allows Windows NT to undo or redo any failed
operations. NTFS5 will undo any incomplete transaction or
transactions that receive errors. Because of the strong
reliability of the NTFS5 file system, you're not required to run
any disk repair utilities to maintain the volume Microft says.
However, I noticed a difference in performance after running
Diskeeper which is a disk defragmentation utility.



FAT/FAT32/NTFS File System Default Cluster Size

FAT32 is made automatically by FDISK when you answer [Y] to Large
Disk Support. When answering [N], the file system is made to FAT
with a defult size of 1.99GB.

The advantage of FAT32 over FAT is that FAT32 will use lot less
space to save the same amount of data since FAT32 cluster size is
smaller than FAT file system. Among the file systems that's used
by Microsoft OS, NTFS & NTFS5 utilizes the least space for save
data and offer additional enhancements such as Compression,
Security, MFT. However, NTFS runs a bit slower than FAT32 since
features such as Security and Compression features must be check
when a NTFS partition is accessed...


FAT

0 to 15MB = 4KB
16MB ~ 31MB = 0.5KB
32MB ~ 63MB = 1KB
64MB ~ 127MB = 2KB
128MB ~ 255MB = 4KB
256MB ~ 511MB = 8KB
512MB ~ 1023MB = 16KB
1024MB ~ 2047MB = 32KB
2048MB ~ 4095MB = 64KB
4096MB ~ 8191MB = 128KB**
8192MB or larger = 256KB**

**To support 4GB or larger FAT partitions that use 128KB or 256KB
clusters, the drives must use sectors larger than 512 bytes.


FAT32

512MB ~ 8191MB = 4KB
8192MB ~ 16,383MB = 8KB
16,384MB ~ 32,767MB = 16KB
32,768MB or larger = 32KB


NTFS5

0 ~ 512MB = 0.5KB
513MB ~ 1024MB = 1KB
1025MB ~ 2048MB = 2KB
2049MB or larger = 4KB
