Auto-Complete RichTextBox

    Whipped this up this afternoon (bored!) so it may not be perfect. It was mentioned/requested here:

    It's a little different from the usual auto-complete textboxes in terms of how the user interacts with it and it's possible to auto-complete any part of a string, not just from the start.

    It's basically just a small class that is initialised by setting a reference to a RichText Box and an ADO recordset.

    Have a play and modify as you see fit. I have no desire to do any more with it as I don't use ADO...
