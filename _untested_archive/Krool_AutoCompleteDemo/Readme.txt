
This readme is referring to the subfolder "AutoCompleteGuids", which contains two files:

-	AutoCompleteGuids.tlb
	
	This is ONLY needed in the IDE.
	Copy that file into the windows system directory.
	In order to use that type library, it is necessary to load the AutoCompleteGuids.tlb in the IDE.
	(Project -> References... -> Browse -> select file AutoCompleteGuids.tlb -> check item "AutoComplete Guid and interface definitions")
	
-	AutoCompleteGuids.odl
	
	That is the file containing the source code.
