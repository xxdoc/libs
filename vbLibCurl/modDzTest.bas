' This function illustrates a couple of key concepts in libcurl.vb.
' First, the data passed in rawBytes is an actual memory address
' from libcurl. Hence, the data is read using the MemByte() function
' found in the VBVM6Lib.tlb type library. Second, the extra parameter
' is passed as a raw long (via ObjPtr(buf)) in Sub EasyGet()), and
' we use the AsObject() function in VBVM6Lib.tlb to get back at it.

 'If extra <> 0 Then
        'Set obj = AsObject(extra)
        'Set buf = obj
        'buf.
        'ObjectPtr(obj) = 0&
        
        
'I would prefer the below: (and no tlb requirement)
'there isnt really a point in using the multi downloads though, unless one server was super slow
'out of several, your bandwidth is limited anyway so just do one at a time should be fine.
'rarely worth the extra complexity for most projects unless your literally making a multi downloader app.
