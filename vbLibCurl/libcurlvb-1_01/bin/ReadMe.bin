                  c-ares-1.2.1 and zlib-1.2.1. It probably should be
                  placed in your PATH.

                  References in order to use libcurl.vb.

-- VBVM6Lib.tlb:  This type library, developed by Michel Rutten, provides
                  access to undocumented memory access functions in Visual
                  Basic 6. It must also be included in your project's
                  References. For more information on this library, see
