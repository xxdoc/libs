libcurl.vb Change Log

Version 1.01 - June 25, 2005

-- Fixed cookie cleanup bug in vbcurl_easy_cleanup(): we now call
   curl_easy_cleanup() BEFORE deallocating strings, which ensures
   that cookie strings can be written during curl_easy_cleanup().
   This was done in easy.c.
   
-- Modified slist.c to add to the tail, not the head.

Version 1.0 - February 28, 2005

-- Initial public release of the source code on sourceforge.net.
