libcurl.vb 1.01 (c) 2005 Jeff Phillips, jeff@jeffp.net

This is the second public source code release of this product
on sourceforge.net.

This is not a COM object, but a very thin API of functions that
will allow you to use most of libcurl's functionality from Visual
Basic 6 and VBA with the VB6 engine. Earlier versions of Visual
Basic will not work. At this point, documentation is somewhat
sparse, so study the samples closely.

The ideal user of this product is probably someone who has worked
with libcurl in C in the past and needs to make something work
with Visual Basic.

Note that libcurl's "share" interface is not implemented right now.

The libcurl.dll file in the bin subdirectory was built with SSL,
c-ares (asynchronous DNS) and zlib (for compression) linked in. It
was built with libcurl 7.13.0, and I'm not sure whether I expect
to keep it up to date with future versions of libcurl.
