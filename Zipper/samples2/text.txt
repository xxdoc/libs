Book 01	Genesis

001:001 In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth.

001:002 And the earth was without form, and void; and darkness was
        upon the face of the deep. And the Spirit of God moved upon
        the face of the waters.

001:003 And God said, Let there be light: and there was light.

001:004 And God saw the light, that it was good: and God divided the
        light from the darkness.

001:005 And God called the light Day, and the darkness he called
        Night. And the evening and the morning were the first day.

001:006 And God said, Let there be a firmament in the midst of the
        waters, and let it divide the waters from the waters.

001:007 And God made the firmament, and divided the waters which were
        under the firmament from the waters which were above the
        firmament: and it was so.

001:008 And God called the firmament Heaven. And the evening and the
        morning were the second day.

001:009 And God said, Let the waters under the heaven be gathered
        together unto one place, and let the dry land appear: and it
        was so.

001:010 And God called the dry land Earth; and the gathering together
        of the waters called he Seas: and God saw that it was good.

001:011 And God said, Let the earth bring forth grass, the herb
        yielding seed, and the fruit tree yielding fruit after his
        kind, whose seed is in itself, upon the earth: and it was so.

001:012 And the earth brought forth grass, and herb yielding seed
        after his kind, and the tree yielding fruit, whose seed was in
        itself, after his kind: and God saw that it was good.

001:013 And the evening and the morning were the third day.

001:014 And God said, Let there be lights in the firmament of the
        heaven to divide the day from the night; and let them be for
        signs, and for seasons, and for days, and years:

001:015 And let them be for lights in the firmament of the heaven to
        give light upon the earth: and it was so.

001:016 And God made two great lights; the greater light to rule the
        day, and the lesser light to rule the night: he made the stars
        also.

001:017 And God set them in the firmament of the heaven to give light
        upon the earth,

001:018 And to rule over the day and over the night, and to divide the
        light from the darkness: and God saw that it was good.

001:019 And the evening and the morning were the fourth day.

001:020 And God said, Let the waters bring forth abundantly the moving
        creature that hath life, and fowl that may fly above the earth
        in the open firmament of heaven.

001:021 And God created great whales, and every living creature that
        moveth, which the waters brought forth abundantly, after their
        kind, and every winged fowl after his kind: and God saw that
        it was good.

001:022 And God blessed them, saying, Be fruitful, and multiply, and
        fill the waters in the seas, and let fowl multiply in the
        earth.

001:023 And the evening and the morning were the fifth day.

001:024 And God said, Let the earth bring forth the living creature
        after his kind, cattle, and creeping thing, and beast of the
        earth after his kind: and it was so.

001:025 And God made the beast of the earth after his kind, and cattle
        after their kind, and every thing that creepeth upon the earth
        after his kind: and God saw that it was good.

001:026 And God said, Let us make man in our image, after our
        likeness: and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea,
        and over the fowl of the air, and over the cattle, and over
        all the earth, and over every creeping thing that creepeth
        upon the earth.

001:027 So God created man in his own image, in the image of God
        created he him; male and female created he them.

001:028 And God blessed them, and God said unto them, Be fruitful, and
        multiply, and replenish the earth, and subdue it: and have
        dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the
        air, and over every living thing that moveth upon the earth.

001:029 And God said, Behold, I have given you every herb bearing
        seed, which is upon the face of all the earth, and every tree,
        in the which is the fruit of a tree yielding seed; to you it
        shall be for meat.

001:030 And to every beast of the earth, and to every fowl of the air,
        and to every thing that creepeth upon the earth, wherein there
        is life, I have given every green herb for meat: and it was
        so.

001:031 And God saw every thing that he had made, and, behold, it was
        very good. And the evening and the morning were the sixth day.

002:001 Thus the heavens and the earth were finished, and all the host
        of them.

002:002 And on the seventh day God ended his work which he had made;
        and he rested on the seventh day from all his work which he
        had made.

002:003 And God blessed the seventh day, and sanctified it: because
        that in it he had rested from all his work which God created
        and made.

002:004 These are the generations of the heavens and of the earth when
        they were created, in the day that the LORD God made the earth
        and the heavens,

002:005 And every plant of the field before it was in the earth, and
        every herb of the field before it grew: for the LORD God had
        not caused it to rain upon the earth, and there was not a man
        to till the ground.

002:006 But there went up a mist from the earth, and watered the whole
        face of the ground.

002:007 And the LORD God formed man of the dust of the ground, and
        breathed into his nostrils the breath of life; and man became
        a living soul.

002:008 And the LORD God planted a garden eastward in Eden; and there
        he put the man whom he had formed.

002:009 And out of the ground made the LORD God to grow every tree
        that is pleasant to the sight, and good for food; the tree of
        life also in the midst of the garden, and the tree of
        knowledge of good and evil.

002:010 And a river went out of Eden to water the garden; and from
        thence it was parted, and became into four heads.

002:011 The name of the first is Pison: that is it which compasseth
        the whole land of Havilah, where there is gold;

002:012 And the gold of that land is good: there is bdellium and the
        onyx stone.

002:013 And the name of the second river is Gihon: the same is it that
        compasseth the whole land of Ethiopia.

002:014 And the name of the third river is Hiddekel: that is it which
        goeth toward the east of Assyria. And the fourth river is
        Euphrates.

002:015 And the LORD God took the man, and put him into the garden of
        Eden to dress it and to keep it.

002:016 And the LORD God commanded the man, saying, Of every tree of
        the garden thou mayest freely eat:

002:017 But of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, thou shalt
        not eat of it: for in the day that thou eatest thereof thou
        shalt surely die.

002:018 And the LORD God said, It is not good that the man should be
        alone; I will make him an help meet for him.

002:019 And out of the ground the LORD God formed every beast of the
        field, and every fowl of the air; and brought them unto Adam
        to see what he would call them: and whatsoever Adam called
        every living creature, that was the name thereof.

002:020 And Adam gave names to all cattle, and to the fowl of the air,
        and to every beast of the field; but for Adam there was not
        found an help meet for him.

002:021 And the LORD God caused a deep sleep to fall upon Adam, and he
        slept: and he took one of his ribs, and closed up the flesh
        instead thereof;

002:022 And the rib, which the LORD God had taken from man, made he a
        woman, and brought her unto the man.

002:023 And Adam said, This is now bone of my bones, and flesh of my
        flesh: she shall be called Woman, because she was taken out of
        Man.

002:024 Therefore shall a man leave his father and his mother, and
        shall cleave unto his wife: and they shall be one flesh.

002:025 And they were both naked, the man and his wife, and were not
        ashamed.

003:001 Now the serpent was more subtil than any beast of the field
        which the LORD God had made. And he said unto the woman, Yea,
        hath God said, Ye shall not eat of every tree of the garden?

003:002 And the woman said unto the serpent, We may eat of the fruit
        of the trees of the garden:

003:003 But of the fruit of the tree which is in the midst of the
        garden, God hath said, Ye shall not eat of it, neither shall
        ye touch it, lest ye die.

003:004 And the serpent said unto the woman, Ye shall not surely die:

003:005 For God doth know that in the day ye eat thereof, then your
        eyes shall be opened, and ye shall be as gods, knowing good
        and evil.

003:006 And when the woman saw that the tree was good for food, and
        that it was pleasant to the eyes, and a tree to be desired to
        make one wise, she took of the fruit thereof, and did eat, and
        gave also unto her husband with her; and he did eat.

003:007 And the eyes of them both were opened, and they knew that they
        were naked; and they sewed fig leaves together, and made
        themselves aprons.

003:008 And they heard the voice of the LORD God walking in the garden
        in the cool of the day: and Adam and his wife hid themselves
        from the presence of the LORD God amongst the trees of the
        garden.

003:009 And the LORD God called unto Adam, and said unto him, Where
        art thou?

003:010 And he said, I heard thy voice in the garden, and I was
        afraid, because I was naked; and I hid myself.

003:011 And he said, Who told thee that thou wast naked? Hast thou
        eaten of the tree, whereof I commanded thee that thou
        shouldest not eat?

003:012 And the man said, The woman whom thou gavest to be with me,
        she gave me of the tree, and I did eat.

003:013 And the LORD God said unto the woman, What is this that thou
        hast done? And the woman said, The serpent beguiled me, and I
        did eat.

003:014 And the LORD God said unto the serpent, Because thou hast done
        this, thou art cursed above all cattle, and above every beast
        of the field; upon thy belly shalt thou go, and dust shalt
        thou eat all the days of thy life:

003:015 And I will put enmity between thee and the woman, and between
        thy seed and her seed; it shall bruise thy head, and thou
        shalt bruise his heel.

003:016 Unto the woman he said, I will greatly multiply thy sorrow and
        thy conception; in sorrow thou shalt bring forth children; and
        thy desire shall be to thy husband, and he shall rule over
        thee.

003:017 And unto Adam he said, Because thou hast hearkened unto the
        voice of thy wife, and hast eaten of the tree, of which I
        commanded thee, saying, Thou shalt not eat of it: cursed is
        the ground for thy sake; in sorrow shalt thou eat of it all
        the days of thy life;

003:018 Thorns also and thistles shall it bring forth to thee; and
        thou shalt eat the herb of the field;

003:019 In the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat bread, till thou
        return unto the ground; for out of it wast thou taken: for
        dust thou art, and unto dust shalt thou return.

003:020 And Adam called his wife's name Eve; because she was the
        mother of all living.

003:021 Unto Adam also and to his wife did the LORD God make coats of
        skins, and clothed them.

003:022 And the LORD God said, Behold, the man is become as one of us,
        to know good and evil: and now, lest he put forth his hand,
        and take also of the tree of life, and eat, and live for ever:

003:023 Therefore the LORD God sent him forth from the garden of Eden,
        to till the ground from whence he was taken.

003:024 So he drove out the man; and he placed at the east of the
        garden of Eden Cherubims, and a flaming sword which turned
        every way, to keep the way of the tree of life.
